Guide to Learning AI with Linux
To begin AI development, a well-configured Linux environment is essential. The following steps outline the process of setting up your system.
I choose Fedora for this development. Which will be the newest version of Fedora v40.
Python:

â€¢sudo apt install python3

â€¢sudo apt install python3-pip

â€¢pip3 install notebook

You can install CUDA which is crucial for this project:

â€¢sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

For this type of project, I'll be making a project called "Building a Basic Neural Network".
